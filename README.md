# RSSBot
An RSS Bot for Discord, using discord4j

## Installation
To run the bot, you need to have Java installed.
Download the rssbot.jar file. In the same folder, download and place the lib folder (with discord4j.jar inside it).
Also, in the same folder, create a settings.xml file.

## Configuration
Edit the settings.xml file as per instructions in settings-tutorial.xml, with help from settings.xml example provided. Please [file an issue](https://github.com/Lord-of-the-Galaxy/RSSBot/issues/new) if you have trouble understanding.

## Run it
You can run the rssbot.jar by double clicking, but I recommend running it from command prompt/shell as you won't be able to see error messages etc otherwise.
To do so - `java -jar rssbot.jar`
